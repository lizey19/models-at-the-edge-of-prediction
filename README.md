# At the Edge of Prediction: Time, Uncertainty, and Physical Models

This project explores how physical systems evolve over time, how uncertainty grows,
and whether patterns truly repeat or only resemble recurrence.

## Core Ideas
- Time evolution using physics-based simulation
- Measurement uncertainty and confidence intervals
- Pattern recurrence using a bouncing ball model

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Statistical uncertainty analysis

## Motivation
Real-world systems are never perfectly predictable. This project shows where models
work and where uncertainty begins.
